So, taking the concept of an RC car, that also has a motor that functions across water like an RC boat, have the body of the toy be an amphibian being. The children's action figures or dolls could ride atop this toy. It could be an amphibious reptile, like a newt or frog. Or it could be something more mystical like a water dragon or a kelpie."
"lzmgzmzdyxtgi-HMNLHD-101","We know that cars and boats are often used for travel and/or transport. But what else can they be used for? Combat! So, we design a toy that allows for all terrain combat. One way with which to accomplish this could be with lasers. Have a futuristic style vehicle that can work on land and water with a remote control and children can 'shoot' eachothers toys which would temporarily disable them. Another way it could work is with a mobile app so that points and damage can be tracked, even with an online leaderboard. My favourite idea as to how it would work would be with a more visual aspect. Have the toy look damaged, like have a part that comes off when it was been hit too much. The main issue that I can see is that a part that comes off could be difficult to retrieve, particularly in water."
"lzmgzmzdyxtgi-HMNLHD-101","My third idea is likely the most difficult to create for real. But so far I have mentioned remote control toys, which are great. But children like to be active. There are many motorised cars in which children can sit and drive around in. But I have yet to see one that can also function as a small boat. Obviously this would have the caveat of safety, as it is already questionable whether a small child should have a toy that they can drive in, let alone across bodies of water. But I think it would be very popular with children."
"lzmgzsfmm27wm-HMNHHD-102","As a musician I like the idea of trying to incorporate music into the toy. I had an idea of a small boat (almost like a pedalo) that is able to play music for children and if the child can pedal to the beat of the music it will give positive rewards like """"well done"""" or gains speed. I feel like this would be a very fun toy as not only does it encourage mobility and has floatability but most importantly it would be very fun for the child."
"lzmgzsfmm27wm-HMNHHD-102","Another idea could be similar to arm bands but customizable for example. The arm bands would have to be very waterproof but if they had maybe small screens in them and the child could choose a photo or gif to have for personalisation."
"lzmgzsfmm27wm-HMNHHD-102","Another toy idea could be a ball (again using technology) that can tell how deep it has gone under water by pressure. It could also give rewarding features when it has been pushed underwater at new personal records. This could be a fun way to teach children to swim and stay underwater in a fun way."

"lzmh2jzz0wgpd-AIRHUT-108","I had an idea around angular momentum and the old toy which would draw curves and such like with a pen tied to an off-centred pendulum.

"lzmo63stxxb6x-HMRHHD-136","'Numbers Jenga' - Taking the game of Jenga, and turning it up to 100. This massive game of Jenga (a full tower coming in at 5ft tall), combines the fun balancing act of Jenga (and the bricks are recommended to be kept on the other side of the room) with Maths, by ensuring you have to stack them in the correct order for two of the bricks having to equal the third bricks number. Not only is there a physical element of balance, spatial awareness and running back and forth, but it challenges their addition skills by ensuring they remember the numbers whilst searching for the correct brick. There is a fun itneraction element for the children together, for them to shout their suggestions over when selecting a brick."
"lzmprsatedtr3-AINLUT-137","A vehicle that functions on both land and water. It would have retractable wheels which would allow it to function on both surfaces. The cognitive ability would come from problem solving as children navigate different terrains and understanding the cause and effect."
"lzmprsatedtr3-AINLUT-137","A modular building platform. One the children could assemble and disassemble various parts creating car and boat or a combination of both. The use of different shapes, colours and piece sizes will advance spatial awareness. Creating puzzles and challenges such as assembling pieces in a certain sequence could develop problem solving skills."
"lzmprsatedtr3-AINLUT-137","An augmented reality toy that combines a car and a boat in a storytelling adventure. It would come with a companion app for mobiles and tablets that would use AR to guide children through interactive adventures. It could project animated scenarios for the toy whether it be a boar or car and create the surrounding environment. Children can solve puzzles and undertake missions within these scenarios building up their cognitive skills. This approach will stimulate imagination, enhance problem solving and ability to learn"
