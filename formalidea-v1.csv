m2kmrcansixgg-HMRH-28-1,"My concept is a calculator in the form of a car for simple mathematical computations, including addition and sbtraction in a base version for younger ages, say 5-6 and extending to include multiplation and division for the version for older kids (till age 11). The car needs to be a decent size to be able to incorporatte easily accessible buttions in a simple calculator interface on the top of the car. The comptations which are entered (eg, 2+4) are then visible on an lcd display in the windscreen of the car. After pressing enter the answer is displayed. Then the car moves to give a visual representation of the answer. For, addition it (for the example of 2+4) it will move in a straight line counting counting up to 2 then display the + sign and start moving again counting to 4 and finally display the answer of 6. This will give a visual representations to youung children learning to cope with such mathematical computations what length/distance different numbers and their combinations represent. Similarly, the othjer computations will be demonstrated as follows. For subtraction the car will move forward by an arbitrary length for the first number and then reverse to represent the subtracting number, again displaying the numbers on the screen counting the numbers as it moves in either direction. For multiplication, the car would move forward by the length of the first number then move right by the lenght of the second number covering the sides of a square of a representative rectangle with such dimensions, and then finally trace out the area of the rectangle by moving up and down along the are of the shape as it counts the answer to the multiplicative solution. For division, the car would move in a straight line to demonstrate the lenght of the first numher then pause to display the division sign and number to be divided by, before driving back the lenght pausing along the length of the solution to the proble, eg for 6/2 the car would drive forward by 6 then do a loop to point backwards and then drive 3 (all the while counting up) then pause before once again driving a length of 3. Different animations on screen at the end of each operation or between driving the initional equation instructions and tracing the solution can make it more lively for kids. Similarly, a mode to test kids development can first drive the appropirate ditances and then request a solution to drive the appropriate distance. If the answer is correct then an animation can provide confirmation, if not then the car can drive again to trace out the ocrrect path an ddemonstrate the visual difference in the solution."
m2kmrcansixgg-HMRH-28-2,"A circular shaped dial game with a core circle displaying mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplation and division, a second outer ring with numbers between 0 and 1, followed by another similar 3rd outer ring. The combination of the first circle and the two subsequent rings will define the mathematical operation. FOr example, 2+5 will be instructed as + chosen in the core circle followed by 2 in the ring immediately adjacent to the circle and then 5 in the second ring. Two further rings will then allow the player to choose the answer, in this case 05 or possibly 5 followed by a blank option in the outer most ring. The core ring (which should be a dynamic lcd display) will then proivide confirmation of whether the response is correct and what it shoud in fact be. The compact circular design of the entire toy would make it easier to carry around."

The first player chooses a number on the screen (perhaps through a simple scrolling mechanism). The ball is then shaken by either the first player or handed to the second player to shake, if played amongst two players. This generates a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction in which case a smaller number must be chosen, multiplication, but no division to avoind dealing with fractional values). Next a player must enter a new number. The game can also be played against an automated oponent to make the 2nd numeric selection. The player must then choose their answer on the screen from the scrolling menu after which the ball will provide a confirmation along with an engaging message to have a fantastical explanation for what the number might represent."

m2ksh7rmn3flg-HMRH-148-1,So one idea for a toy would be to integrate a basketball with computation. Like maybe there's an app that it attaches to the ball that computes the trajectory of the basketball whether it misses or makes it through. And then sends the data to the app so the player can see like the miss and score rates. If they are overshooting or undershooting. It encourages the player to move since it would be super interesting to see the analytics of it since most people don't track it and its bothersome to anyways. You can see progress to which encourages more playing ball which is healthy.
m2ksh7rmn3flg-HMRH-148-2,Another idea is have like this toy robot that the parent can turn on for their baby that rolls to play hide and seek with it.
