m2kmrcansixgg-HMRH-28-1,"My concept is a calculator in the form of a car for simple mathematical computations, including addition and sbtraction in a base version for younger ages, say 5-6 and extending to include multiplation and division for the version for older kids (till age 11). The car needs to be a decent size to be able to incorporatte easily accessible buttions in a simple calculator interface on the top of the car. The comptations which are entered (eg, 2+4) are then visible on an lcd display in the windscreen of the car. After pressing enter the answer is displayed. Then the car moves to give a visual representation of the answer. For, addition it (for the example of 2+4) it will move in a straight line counting counting up to 2 then display the + sign and start moving again counting to 4 and finally display the answer of 6. This will give a visual representations to youung children learning to cope with such mathematical computations what length/distance different numbers and their combinations represent. Similarly, the othjer computations will be demonstrated as follows. For subtraction the car will move forward by an arbitrary length for the first number and then reverse to represent the subtracting number, again displaying the numbers on the screen counting the numbers as it moves in either direction. For multiplication, the car would move forward by the length of the first number then move right by the lenght of the second number covering the sides of a square of a representative rectangle with such dimensions, and then finally trace out the area of the rectangle by moving up and down along the are of the shape as it counts the answer to the multiplicative solution. For division, the car would move in a straight line to demonstrate the lenght of the first numher then pause to display the division sign and number to be divided by, before driving back the lenght pausing along the length of the solution to the proble, eg for 6/2 the car would drive forward by 6 then do a loop to point backwards and then drive 3 (all the while counting up) then pause before once again driving a length of 3. Different animations on screen at the end of each operation or between driving the initional equation instructions and tracing the solution can make it more lively for kids. Similarly, a mode to test kids development can first drive the appropirate ditances and then request a solution to drive the appropriate distance. If the answer is correct then an animation can provide confirmation, if not then the car can drive again to trace out the ocrrect path an ddemonstrate the visual difference in the solution."
m2kmrcansixgg-HMRH-28-2,"A circular shaped dial game with a core circle displaying mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplation and division, a second outer ring with numbers between 0 and 1, followed by another similar 3rd outer ring. The combination of the first circle and the two subsequent rings will define the mathematical operation. FOr example, 2+5 will be instructed as + chosen in the core circle followed by 2 in the ring immediately adjacent to the circle and then 5 in the second ring. Two further rings will then allow the player to choose the answer, in this case 05 or possibly 5 followed by a blank option in the outer most ring. The core ring (which should be a dynamic lcd display) will then proivide confirmation of whether the response is correct and what it shoud in fact be. The compact circular design of the entire toy would make it easier to carry around."
m2kmrcansixgg-HMRH-28-3,"A ball with an lcd display, a bit like a magic 8 ball. The game can be played by a single player or between two players. The first player chooses a number on the screen (perhaps through a simple scrolling mechanism). The ball is then shaken by either the first player or handed to the second player to shake, if played amongst two players. This generates a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction in which case a smaller number must be chosen, multiplication, but no division to avoind dealing with fractional values). Next a player must enter a new number. The game can also be played against an automated oponent to make the 2nd numeric selection. The player must then choose their answer on the screen from the scrolling menu after which the ball will provide a confirmation along with an engaging message to have a fantastical explanation for what the number might represent."

m2ksh7rmn3flg-HMRH-148-1,So one idea for a toy would be to integrate a basketball with computation. Like maybe there's an app that it attaches to the ball that computes the trajectory of the basketball whether it misses or makes it through. And then sends the data to the app so the player can see like the miss and score rates. If they are overshooting or undershooting. It encourages the player to move since it would be super interesting to see the analytics of it since most people don't track it and its bothersome to anyways. You can see progress to which encourages more playing ball which is healthy.
m2ksh7rmn3flg-HMRH-148-2,Another idea is have like this toy robot that the parent can turn on for their baby that rolls to play hide and seek with it. It would would have cameras and compute like the distance the baby is from it and make some sounds to give the baby some hints. It helps encourage movement and exercise for babies.
m2ksh7rmn3flg-HMRH-148-3,"Another idea is to have an app on for kids that encourages exercise. It has a camera, computer vision and kind of do like wiifit kind of thing. It calculates the workout ativities for the kid and in a fun way through games like bowinling, jumping jacks, etc"
m2kspqjuassfc-AIRH-152-1,"In my first idea i actually asked for a product idea i would want, it is a common thing for PC users to have cold hands as they use thier prephirels. And the idea proposed sounds very effective and i would actually buy it if i could lol. It talks about a mousepad i can simply plug into a usb slot and control its temprature, that sounds perfect."
m2kspqjuassfc-AIRH-152-2,"Second idea sounds like a product that would go viral instantly, its hard for me decide aht sort of clothes i would want to buy, and this mirror/screen hybrid will use AR to track my body and fit clothes on me so i can save the trouble of actually physcially trying on these clothes and travelling to these sites to see how i look"
m2kspqjuassfc-AIRH-152-3,A toy that the AI robot recommended to me is the RoboSkate which sounds great. Its a RC skateboard that the teens can do simple programming to and control its movement. The fact it comes with an app to teach them how to do is great

m2kspqjuassfc-AIRH-152-5,"Another toy it recommended was the TumbleTot express, which will be a ride on train the kids will be on, and they will press simple buttoms and dials that will let them choose the direction and speed of the train. It also allows them to control its sounds"
m2ksrswp9ej71-HMRH-156-1,"My first idea is a toy which I would desribe as an electric kite. It would resemble unique or popular animals. Perhaps some from anime such as the flying bison from avatar called Appa. This would be fun for children as the kite would not rely on it being windy and so children could fly the kite whenever they want, the computation aspect could be an extra remote or the ability to control the animal from a tablet/phonne. There could also be a camera within it and so children could take photos."
m2ksrswp9ej71-HMRH-156-2,My second idea is escape room enclosed within a large box. However rooms and doors can not be opened. Children would have to engage with the rooms through an external screen such as a tablet and figure out the how to escape the rooms. When a room is escaped then there could be another puzzle which must be worked on physically. So essentially you are combining physical and computer in a very fun and engaging game.
m2ksrswp9ej71-HMRH-156-3,"My third idea is a brush, a child who likes drawing or painting can customise and change colours by pressing harder. Furthermore there could be a holographic aspect where a child can say or input what he wants to draw and it will show an image. It could also give instructions on how to draw and give helpful tips, perhaps a mode where when the pen is held it can guide a child to draw."
m2ksrswp9ej71-HMRH-156-4,"My fourth idea is a sort of twist on building blocks, the twist ist that the building blocks  can change shapes and the task would be to make items but the shapes are unconventional, this will be a unique and creative way for children to think out of the box, the computer element will give feedback and at the end show how to achieve the shape."
