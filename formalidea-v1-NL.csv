m2m2hcth2ze2x-HMNL-385-1,"I would produce a small motorised vehicle  that can be controlled (steered) via bluetooth using a phone app. On land, it would propel itself using wheels. However, it would be capable of floating and at the touch of a button, the wheels would retract and it would switch to propeller mode and function as a boat."
m2m2hcth2ze2x-HMNL-385-2,"My second idea is for a larger vehicle with wheelsthat the child can sit in and propel with their feet (it would have no floor, so the child's feet could push the vehicle along. It would be steered using a steering wheel. It would again be capable of floating, though it would need to be VERY stable! When in the water, the child could either propel it by kicking their feet, or better still, there would be hand cranked rotary paddles (like on a paddle-steamer) each side that could function both to propel the boat and to steer it. Another version might also use hand-cranking to propel and steer the vehicle on land."
m2m2hcth2ze2x-HMNL-385-3,"The final version would be a construction kit using which the child could make either a boat, a car or a vehicle that combined the two in one form. This kit would include various types of motor, wheels and even tracks. It might have instructions as to how to build various classic amphibious vehicles such as the DUKW and VW Schwimmwagen from WWII - these are essentially a combination of car and boat!"

m2m3pt9l86i1l-HMNL-409-1,"Design A toy with interchangeable parts that let children construct either a car or a boat, with the flexibility to combine features of both.  Play Concept Kids can build a car that rolls on wheels or replace the wheels with buoyant components to convert it into a floating boat. This design encourages creativity and critical thinking as they experiment with different configurations.  Features  The toy could include motorized elements for the boat, or a pull-back mechanism for the car. It would come with vibrant, modular parts in various colors, allowing children to easily mix and match different components."
m2m3pt9l86i1l-HMNL-409-2,"This toy would be an exciting car that turns into a boat when exposed to water. It would allow kids to drive it on land like a normal toy car, but once placed in water (e.g., in a bathtub or pool), it transforms into a boat and floats. The idea is to make the transition between land and water seamless, creating a fun experience for kids who enjoy both car races and water play."
m2m3pt9l86i1l-HMNL-409-3,"This toy set features a combination of a car race track and a waterway for boats. The excitement comes from racing the car down the track, which finishes in a splash zone, such as a small pool or canal. Once the car reaches the water, it transforms into a boat, allowing it to float and continue the adventure in the water."
m2m3ykajc3qau-AINL-413-1,"I have an idea about designing a children's electric car to be waterproof so that it can continue to travel over bodies of water. For safety, the cabin of the occupant would have to be sealed watertight, including any doors and windows. There would have to be a flotation device available in case of emergencies. All electrical components would have to be waterproof as well."
m2m3ykajc3qau-AINL-413-2,"I have an idea for a remote controlled vehicle toy that functions as a car on land and a boat on water. To accomplish this, it would have to change seamlessly from car to boat, or vice versa, as the situation demands. Car wheels would have to retract if the vehicle enters water, and any boat motor would have to retract if the vehicle changes back into a car. The entire vehicle would have to be waterproof, especially electrical components. It could also be adorned with LED lights for style. The remote control could be able to switch functions depending on which mode the vehicle was using."
m2m3ykajc3qau-AINL-413-3,"I have an idea for a bathtub toy that looks like a boat and floats. But it also has compartments that can be flooded with water, making the toy less buoyant and causing it to sink. The child playing with the toy can alternate these two modes, so that in floating mode the toy acts as a boat, but in sinking mode, the toy sinks to the bottom of the tub and acts as a car, and the child can pretend to be exploring the ocean bottom."

It would have, for example, a moving steering wheel and buttons to press, so children could pretend they were driving, sailing or even flying in this magical machine."
m2m4vz3rhjta6-HMNL-433-2,"I would pull apart the boat and the car and reserve whatever pieces were safe for children to play with so they could repurpose them creatively. Research suggests that when children are allowed to play with tools like wood, hammer and nails they thrive. It's good for their development, builds problem-solving skills and encourages creativity. The toy I would make would be the equivalent of a box of Lego or wooden blocks, but instead it would be a sort of kit containing real materials from a car and a boat. Children could be allowed to make anything they wanted from this kit, from playhouses to works of art."
m2m4vz3rhjta6-HMNL-433-3,"I'd remove the wheels from the car and use elements from both the car and the boat to create a go-cart that's safe for small children to play in. Children used to make these from old soap boxes and spare wheels, but it's fallen out of fashion, probably due to safety concerns and the ability to purchase ready made bicycles and tricycles. But I think a return to the concept of repurposing components to make go-carts would be beneficial for children and could be done safely."

I would also ensure that part of the model design would encorporate a basic form of CAD software that would aid learning combined with AI technology that would assist the child in creating the final design. It could then be transferred onto a 3D printing software and printers this giving a child total control over the design but also be an educational tool in helping to solve problems that will inevitiably arise.
